# Introduction

Use the left hand menu to browse to the various styles that are to be implemented into wiserconnect.co.uk

This was designed to allow anyone to understand the core elements of the Wiser Connect website. Using this as a reference point will speed-up development, however this is not a guide on how you should code, but rather as guide to make design decisions for you.

You can use any styleguide for code standard such as Airbnb, but ultimely some overrides will need to occur.

# Key design choices

* __Single Page__ This should be a single page application.
* __3 Click Rule__ you should be able to get to any page on the website within 3 clicks.
* __Bootstrap__ you can develop the site using vanilla bootstrap but overrides will need to be implemented for our custom colour schemes.
